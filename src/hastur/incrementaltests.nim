# ---- Incremental-build regression test ------------------------------------
# `nifmake --report` prints a machine-readable summary of which commands
# actually executed during one nifmake invocation. We drive `bin/nimony c
# --report` over `tests/incremental/sample.nim` through a sequence of
# scenarios and assert on the per-phase counts. This catches mtime-tracking
# regressions (e.g. tools that drift back into "always rewrite" and trigger
# perpetual rebuilds, or staleness checks that miss real edits) without
# the brittleness of comparing file timestamps.
