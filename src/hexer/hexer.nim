Hexer
------

Hexer is our middle-end. It transforms Nimony code into NIFC code. This requires
multiple different steps.

- Iterator inlining.
- Lambda lifting.
- Inject dups.
- Lower control flow expressions to control flow statements (elminate the expr/nkStmtListExpr construct).
- Inject destructors.
- Map builtins like new and + to "compiler procs".
- Translate exception handling.


NIFC generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- It copies used imported symbols into the current NIF file. As a fix point operation
  until no foreign symbols are left.
- `importc`'ed symbols are replaced by their `.c` variants.
- `importc`'ed symbols might lead to `(incl "file.h")` injections.
- Nim types must be translated to NIFC types.
- Types and procs must be moved to toplevel statements.


Grammar
-------

Hexer accepts Nimony's grammar.
