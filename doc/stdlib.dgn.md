### Comparison operators

####==
Equality

####!=
Inequality. This is a generic template that means you **should not** implement it for your own types. Implement only `==` instead.

####>
Greater than. This is a generic template that means you **should not** implement it for your own types. Implement only `<` instead.

####=>
Greater than or equal to. This is a generic template that means you **should not** implement it for your own types. Implement only `>=` instead.

####<
Less than.

####<=
Less than or equal to.

####is

Returns true if the object is of the given type. This is a compile-time check.

####isnot

The negation of `is`. This is a compile-time check.

####of

Returns true if the object is of the given subtype. This is a runtime check.


####contains

### Memory management

####sizeof

### Miscellaneous operations

####default

Returns the default value for a type.

###typeof

Returns the type of an expression

### String and sequence operations

####len
Length of a string/seq/array/etc.

####high

####toOpenArray

Converts a string/seq/array/etc to an open array.


####rawData

Provides an unchecked view into the underlying data of a string/seq. The data is guaranteed to be sequential in memory.

####borrowCStringUnsafe

Borrows a C string from a Nim string. This is unsafe because the Nim string may be moved or deallocated while the C string is still in use.


####setLen

####grow

Grows a `seq` by a given number of elements. The elements are default initialized.

####growUnsafe

Grows a `seq` by a given number of elements. The elements are not  initialized. Use with care!

####shrink

Shrinks a string/seq/array/etc.

####toCString

Converts a Nim string to a C string.

####prepareMutation

Prepares a string for mutation. String literals are "copy on write", so you need to call `prepareMutation` before modifying strings via `addr`.


####&

####concat

Concatenates many strings.


####substr

Returns a substring of a string.

####addEscapedChar
Add escaped character to string.

####addQuoted
Add quoted value to string.

####items

####newSeqUninit

Creates a new `seq` with a given length. The elements are not initialized. Use with care!

####@

Creates a new `seq` from an `array`. Typically used with an array constructor, for example: `@[1, 2, 3]`.


####newString

Creates a new `string` with a given length. The elements are not initialized. Use with care!

####del

Deletes an element from a `seq` by swapping it with its last element and then setting the internal length field. Thus it is O(1) but it does change the order of the elements.

####pop

Pops the last element from a `seq` and returns it.

### Iterators

Inclusive range iterator.

####..<
Exclusive range iterator.

####countdown
Countdown iterator.

####fields

## Collections

### Hashes

Computing a hash value is a prerequisite for using the value as a key in a table datastructure. A table is general (key, value)-store.

@../lib/std/hashes.nim

####Hash

This integer type is used to hold hash values. A hash is also called a "checksum". Two hashes can be combined into one new hash by the `!&` operator. The result after one or many combinations should be finished with the `!$` operator.

####Hashable

A concept that describes what a type must fullfill in order to be considered hashable.


####hash

The overloaded `hash` operation returns the hash of a value.

####nextTry

To iterate over a search space of possible hash values, `nextTry` can be used.

### Tables

@../lib/std/tables.nim

####Keyable

A concept that describes what a type must fulfill in order to be used as a key in a table. A keyable type must have:
- An equality operator `==` that compares two values of the type
- A `hash` procedure that computes a hash value for the type

####Table

A generic hash table that stores key-value pairs. The table uses a hybrid approach:
- For small tables (≤ 4 entries), it uses linear search
- For larger tables, it uses a hash table with open addressing

####contains

Checks if a key exists in the table.

####hasKey

Alias for `contains`.

####getOrDefault

Retrieves a value for a key, returning the default value if the key is not found.

####getOrQuit

Retrieves a value for a key, quits the program if the key is not found.

####[]

Retrieves a value for a key. Raises `KeyError` if the key is not found.

####[]=

Sets a value for a key. If the key already exists, the value is updated; otherwise, a new entry is added.

####mgetOrPut

Retrieves a value for a key, or adds a new entry with the default value if the key doesn't exist. Returns a mutable reference to the value.

####len

Returns the number of key-value pairs in the table.

####pairs

Iterates over all key-value pairs in the table.

####mpairs

Iterates over all key-value pairs in the table, providing mutable access to values.

####initTable

Creates a new empty table.


### Sets

@../lib/std/sets.nim

####HashSet

A generic hash set data structure that stores unique values. Implemented using a hash table where values are mapped to boolean true.

####initHashSet

Creates a new empty hash set.

####incl

Adds an element to the hash set.

####excl

Removes an element from the hash set.

####contains

Checks if an element is present in the hash set.

####containsOrIncl

Checks if an element is present in the hash set, and if not, adds it. Returns true if the element was already present.

####items

An iterator that yields all elements in the hash set.


## Generic Operating System Services

### pathnorm

@../lib/std/pathnorm.nim

####PathIter

An object used to iterate over path components.

####hasNext

Checks whether the `PathIter` has another path component in the given input string.

####next

Advances a `PathIter` and returns a `(start, end)` pair representing the bounds of the next path component within the provided string.

####addNormalizePath

Low-level procedure that appends a normalized representation of `x` to the `result` string and updates the `state`.

####normalizePath

Returns a normalized path string. It collapses repeated separators, resolves `.` and `..` where possible, and returns `.` for an empty normalized path. The optional `dirSep` parameter controls the separator used in the result.

### envvars

@../lib/std/envvars.nim

Provides utilities for reading and modifying process environment variables.

####getEnv

Returns the value of the environment variable named `key`.

If the variable does not exist the `default` argument (empty string by default) is returned. Use `existsEnv` when you need to distinguish between a missing variable and an empty value.

####existsEnv

Returns true if the environment variable named `key` exists, false otherwise.

####putEnv

Sets the environment variable `key` to `val` for the current process.
On error an `OSError` is raised.

####delEnv

Removes the environment variable named `key` from the current process environment. If the variable is not present the call is a no-op. On error an `OSError` is raised.

####envPairs

Iterator yielding all environment variable pairs as tuples `(key, value)`.


### paths

@../lib/std/paths.nim

This module implements path handling.

####Path
A path object that holds the path data.

####initPath
Creates a new path from a string.

####`$`
String conversion for Path.

####hash
Computes hash for a Path. On a case-sensitive filesystem this is done case-sensitively otherwise case-insensitively.

####`==`
Compares two paths. On a case-sensitive filesystem this is done case-sensitively otherwise case-insensitively.

####add
Adds a path to another path.

####`/`
Joins two directory names to one. Returns normalized path concatenation of `head` and `tail`, preserving whether or not `tail` has a trailing slash (or, if tail if empty, whether head has one).

####splitPath
Splits a directory into `(head, tail)` tuple, so that `head / tail == path` (except for edge cases like "/usr").

####splitFile
Splits a filename into `(dir, name, extension)` tuple. `dir` does not end in DirSep unless it's `/`. `extension` includes the leading dot. If `path` has no extension, `ext` is the empty string. If `path` has no directory component, `dir` is the empty string. If `path` has no filename component, `name` and `ext` are empty strings.

####isAbsolute
Checks whether a given `path` is absolute. On Windows, network paths are considered absolute too.

####relativePath
Converts `path` to a path relative to `base`. The `sep` (default: DirSep) is used for the path normalizations, this can be useful to ensure the relative path only contains `'/'` so that it can be used for URL constructions. On Windows, if a root of `path` and a root of `base` are different, returns `path` as is because it is impossible to make a relative path. That means an absolute path can be returned.

####isRelativeTo
Returns true if `path` is relative to `base`.

####parentDir
Returns the parent directory of `path`. This is similar to `splitPath(path).head` when `path` doesn't end in a dir separator, but also takes care of path normalizations.

####tailDir
Returns the tail part of `path`.

####isRootDir
Checks whether a given `path` is a root directory.

####parentDirs
Iterator that walks over all parent directories of a given `path`. If `fromRoot` is true (default: false), the traversal will start from the file system root directory. If `inclusive` is true (default), the original argument will be included in the traversal. Relative paths won't be expanded by this iterator. Instead, it will traverse only the directories appearing in the relative path.

####`/../`
The same as `parentDir(head) / tail`, unless there is no parent directory. Then `head / tail` is performed instead.

####extractFilename
Extracts the filename of a given `path`. This is the same as `name & ext` from splitFile.

####lastPathPart
Like extractFilename, but ignores trailing dir separator; aka: baseName in some other languages.

####changeFileExt
Changes the file extension to `ext`. If the `filename` has no extension, `ext` will be added. If `ext` == "" then any extension is removed. `Ext` should be given without the leading `'.'`, because some filesystems may use a different character.

####addFileExt
Adds the file extension `ext` to `filename`, unless `filename` already has an extension. `Ext` should be given without the leading `'.'`, because some filesystems may use a different character.

####unixToNativePath
Converts an UNIX-like path to a native one. On an UNIX system this does nothing. Else it converts `'/'`, `'.'`, `'..'` to the appropriate things. On systems with a concept of "drives", `drive` is used to determine which drive label to use during absolute path conversion. `drive` defaults to the drive of the current working directory, and is ignored on systems that do not have a concept of "drives".

####getCurrentDir
Returns the current working directory i.e. where the built binary is run. The path returned by this proc is determined at run time.

####normalizeExe
Normalize executable name. On Windows this proc will check if an `.exe` extension needs to be added. On other platforms it does nothing.

####normalizePath
Normalize a path. Consecutive directory separators are collapsed, including directory separators at the end of the path.

####normalizePathEnd
Normalize path so that it maintains a trailing separator or not depending on the value of the `trailingSep` parameter.

####absolutePath
Returns the absolute path of `path`, rooted at `root` (which must be absolute; default: current directory). If `path` is absolute, return it, ignoring `root`.

####expandTilde
Expands `~` or a path starting with `~/` to a full path, replacing `~` with getHomeDir() (otherwise returns `path` unmodified). Windows: this is still supported despite the Windows platform not having this convention; also, both `~/` and `~\\ ` are handled.


### appdirs

@../lib/std/appdirs.nim

This module implements helpers for determining special directories used by apps.

####getHomeDir
Returns the home directory of the current user as a Path. Used for expanding `~` in user configuration files.

####getDataDir
Returns the data directory of the current user for applications. On non-Windows OSs, this follows the XDG Base Directory spec and uses the `XDG_DATA_HOME` environment variable if set, otherwise defaults to `~/.local/share` or `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS.

####getConfigDir
Returns the config directory of the current user for applications. On non-Windows OSs, this follows the XDG Base Directory spec and uses the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable if set, otherwise defaults to `~/.config/`. The returned string always ends with an OS-dependent trailing slash.

####getCacheDir
Returns the cache directory of the current user for applications. Uses platform-specific environment variables:
- Windows: `LOCALAPPDATA`
- macOS: `XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `HOME/Library/Caches`
- Other: `XDG_CACHE_HOME` or `HOME/.cache`

####getCacheDir(app: Path)
Returns the cache directory for a specific application. On Windows, this is `getCacheDir() / app / "cache"`; on other platforms, `getCacheDir() / app`.

####getTempDir
Returns the temporary directory for the current user. On Windows, uses `GetTempPath`. On POSIX, checks `TMPDIR`, `TEMP`, `TMP`, and `TEMPDIR` environment variables, defaulting to `/tmp` if none are set. The implementation can be overridden with `-d:tempDir=mytempname` at compile time. Does not check if the returned path exists.



### Threads

@../lib/std/rawthreads.nim

####getThreadId

Gets the ID of the currently running thread. This uses a cached value to avoid performing a syscall. Do not assume any value range for thread IDs!

####RawThread

A type that represents a raw thread.

####create

Creates a new thread. Runs `fn(arg)` on the newly created thread. `stackSize` is the size of the stack for the thread, if its default value 0 is used, a system specific stack size is used (typically 2MB).

`pinnedToCpu` is the CPU number to pin the thread to. If it is not -1, it is attempted to run the thread on the given CPU number. If the attempt fails, the thread will run on a different CPU. The standard library offers no way to check if the thread is actually pinned to the given CPU. Also, some platforms like OSX fundamentaly do not support pinning.


####join

Joins a thread. Waits for the thread to finish.
